[^1]: I'm a talent acquisition professional aka recruiter aka job whisperer.
[^2]: Fun fact, the first time I had an inkling of this skill was when I helped line up [The Klezmatics](https://www.klezmatics.com/) for a friend's wedding, and her mother explained the concept of a shadchan to me. 🥰  
[^3]: Bests? A European tour including a [busker festival](https://www.ferrarabuskers.com/) in Ferrara, Italy, recording and touring with [Bio Ritmo](https://www.bioritmo.com/) and [Squirrel Nut Zippers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sold_Out_(Squirrel_Nut_Zippers_album)#Additional_personnel), and several years of debauchery on the high seas as a musician for Carnival Cruise Lines.
